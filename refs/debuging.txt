- Apparently server doesn't handle when a client disconnects suddenly
- doing a classic GET request on a dir location that doesn't have autoindex: on still goes through
  GetStaticFile()
- Apparently, when doing a GET request, in the server routine(), the request is correctly registered
  and GetStaticFile constructor is called, then header is correctly written down
- Everything fine until executeRoute() as of now ?
- executeRoute() sends the setRessource IOEvent correctly ?

- Then I have no idea why, but from executeRoute we should use the Ressource, instead we go back
  to Connexion::parseHeader()
